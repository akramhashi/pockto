        <h2 class="work">how does it work ?</h2>
        <h5 class="content">How Our Signals Work: <br>

            -Signals are sent before the next M1 candle opens. ⏳ <br>

            -Wait for the new candle to start before placing your trade. 🕒 <br>

            -Be Alert: We send the signal when there are 40 to 20 seconds left in the current candle. ⏱️ <br>

            👉 Example Signal Setup: <br>

            🌐 USD/SGD | OTC <br>
            📉 Signal: ( Sell ) on NEXT 1-minute candle <br>
            ⏳ Trade Duration: 1 Minute <br>
            🎯 Martingale Levels (After Losing Trade): <br>
            🔄 1st Level (if loss): Next 1-minute candle after loss <br>
            🔄 2nd Level (if loss): Next 1-minute candle after 1st loss <br>


            💡 Execute a Sell trade on the next candle and adjust for losses with Martingale!</h5>

        <h5 class="content">Our signals are designed to maintain high accuracy and reliability, with minimal distortion
            or interference. We use advanced signal processing techniques to ensure that the signal you receive closely
            matches the original transmission. Accuracy is regularly tested and maintained through various metrics,
            including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER). Additionally, our systems are calibrated to
            industry standards to ensure optimal performance in real-world conditions, providing you with consistent and
            precise signal quality.</h5>
